# Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists

My implementation of [this **AMAZING** book][book].

## Setting up
Set up Rust Stable via `rustup`. Then, at the shell, run

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/jo12bar/rust-too-many-lists lists
$ cd lists
$ cargo build # to build everything
$ cargo test  # to run tests
```
